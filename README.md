# DataSpark Presentations 
In this repository we share some of the presentations that we prepare in DataSpark. Presentaions are prepared using
[reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) framework and as suggested in its documentation, this repository is a
fork of the original one.

Presentations can be run through `node.js` as explained in the [original documentation](README.orig.md) or by
running a simple python http server:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
